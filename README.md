The goal of this project was to develop an ML model, that predicts how many moves have left to end a chess game or if there is a draw.

Giving dataset ([link](https://www.apispreadsheets.com/datasets/115)) contains positions of chessmen for the very specific situation when on a board left only: black king, white king, and white rook. In those types of endgame situations, the black king can not win.

Structure of the project:

* EDA, preprocessing, adding new features
  
* Developing various models, hyperparameter tunning
  
* Choose of the final model, evaluation, and interpretability of the model using SHAP

An important thing to mention is that this project was written in Polish (titles of sections and comments). The code itself was written in English.
